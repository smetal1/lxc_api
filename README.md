1. This project is used to create a middle-ware layer to leverage the functions of LXC-LXD conatiners in ubuntu.
2. I am using ubuntu: 16.04 LTS (xenial) with LXD.
3. The aim of this project is to enable on-the-fly deployment of nodejs applications. 
4. User just need to provide us with the shared link of his project (google drive/dropbox/github) and this application will automatically deploy his application solving all dependencies.
5. User can also specify his OS type available on the user dashboard (pending) and architecture of the OS, the rest deployment will be handled by the middleware.
6. As soon as the application is deployed, the user will be intimated by a mail and on the dashboard.

7. User dashboard (pending) - will display all the services consumed by an user and the network traffic of those services.
8. Implementation of LXC networking part, limiting user's previlage and upload file limit is pending.
